**LearnUp**
**Objective**
The project focuses on creating comprehensive documentation for the LearnUp online learning platform. The project includes two main documents: Requirements and Architecture, outlining the systemâ€™s functional and technical specifications. The goal is to provide a solid foundation for the development of the platform, covering aspects such as user management, course management, security, and system architecture. This project offers an opportunity to understand the planning and design phases of software development.

**Skills Learned**
- Requirements Gathering and Documentation: Understanding how to document functional and non-functional requirements for a software project.
- System Architecture Design: Experience in defining and structuring the architecture of a web-based system.
- Understanding Software Development Lifecycles: Gaining insights into how software is planned, designed, and structured before development.
- Communication and Collaboration: Working with documentation tools to share ideas clearly and effectively within a team.

**Tools Used**
- Lucidchart: Used to create detailed diagrams and flowcharts for system architecture and process design.
- Google Docs: For collaborative writing and refining the documents.
- GitHub: For version control and sharing of the project repository.
